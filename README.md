Pikatwo is an IRC-enabled chat bot that logs IRC chatter, and uses it to construct a log full of commentary. The bot will then regurgitate this commentary in a hopefully-amusing fashion when someone speaks to it on IRC.

This was ported from a very old python project, and was rewritten maybe 2 times before arriving at its final succulent state.
