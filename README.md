Pikatwo is an IRC-enabled chat bot that logs IRC chatter, and uses it to construct a log full of commentary. The bot will then regurgitate this commentary in a hopefully-amusing fashion when someone speaks to it on IRC.

This is being partially ported from a very old python project, and the port is still not yet complete. Right now the logger is implemented, and the bot can log into IRC to record conversations through a neat gui. Still have to get around to implementing the response stuff and remote access.
